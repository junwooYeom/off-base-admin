## Testing Checklist

### Admin Features
- [ ] Login with super admin account (luminate5991@gmail.com)
- [ ] Verify super admin can manage other admins
- [ ] Verify regular admins cannot modify other admins
- [ ] Test admin approval/rejection workflow

### Property Documents
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/properties/[id]/documents`
- [ ] Verify documents are visible
- [ ] Test document upload functionality
- [ ] Test document download functionality

### Verification Pages
- [ ] Property verification page loads (`/admin/verification/properties`)

## Important Notes

1. **Database Consistency**: The master branch (bjwhxrapqobyjccnviud) is now synchronized with the main branch structure.

2. **Future SQL Executions**: As requested, all future SQL executions will be performed on the master/dev branch (bjwhxrapqobyjccnviud).

3. **RLS Policies**: The current RLS policies are permissive for testing. Consider tightening them for production use.

4. **Password Hashes**: Admin password hashes have been preserved during migration. Users can log in with their existing credentials.

## Next Steps

1. Test all admin functionalities on the master branch
2. Verify property management features work correctly
3. Consider implementing audit logging for admin actions
4. Review and potentially tighten RLS policies for production

## Migration Commands Reference

For future reference, the key migrations applied were:
```sql
-- Super Admin Feature
ALTER TABLE public.admins ADD COLUMN is_super_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

ALTER TABLE [table_name] ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON [table_name] FOR [operation] USING (condition);
```

If any issues arise after this migration:
1. Check Supabase logs for RLS policy violations
2. Verify the correct project ID is being used in the application
3. Ensure environment variables point to the master branch project
